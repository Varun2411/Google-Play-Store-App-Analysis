# Google-Play-Store-App-Analysis

## Introduction
This project provides an analysis of various apps available on the Google Play Store. By exploring different aspects of the apps, such as user ratings, categories, pricing strategies, and more, we aim to uncover valuable insights and trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about various apps from the Google Play Store, including:
- App name
- Category
- User rating
- Number of reviews
- Size of the app
- Number of installs
- Type (Free or Paid)
- Price (if paid)
- Content rating
- Genres
- Last updated date
- Current version
- Minimum Android version required

## Analysis
The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter notebook (`Project 1.ipynb`) and covers the following aspects:
- Distribution of apps across different categories
- Rating distribution across categories
- Correlation between app size and rating
- Pricing strategies and their impact on app ratings and reviews
- Popularity of apps based on the number of installs

## Getting Started
To explore the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-play-store-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd google-play-store-analysis
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/Project\ 1.ipynb
    ```

## Results
The detailed results and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter notebook. Key findings include:
- The majority of apps are free, with a significant portion belonging to the 'Family' and 'Game' categories.
- Higher-rated apps tend to have smaller sizes and belong to specific categories like 'Education' and 'Books & Reference'.
- Paid apps generally have higher ratings compared to free apps.
